  I’m Curtis Bolden, a Structural BIM/VDC specialist and developer. I design reliable tools and workflows
  that reduce friction for project teams — pyRevit/C# automation, Revit→Power BI data flows, and clean handoffs
  to structural analysis. I do not offer or stamp engineering services; I support licensed teams with better
  automation, visibility, and delivery.
